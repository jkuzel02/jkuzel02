ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jkuzel02
# Welcome to my GitHub profile!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Coding, Programming, Networking, DevOps & many more.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with git ðŸ˜€  
- âš¡ Fun fact: besides computers, I ride scooters (like the ones that kids do ðŸ›´, yeah! - except I need a bigger size, because of an average local adult's height).
