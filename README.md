ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xkuzel
# Welcome to my GitHub profile!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Coding, Programming, Networking, DevOps & many more.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with git ðŸ˜€

- âš¡ Fun facts:
  
- I live in the Czech Republic, Central Europe (consider it Eastern or Western yourself, I don't really care ðŸ˜€, I am using what I'd been taught in local schools).
- My birthdate dates to June 2002.
- besides computers, I ride scooters (like the one that kids do, yeah! - except I need a bigger size, because of an average local adult's height).
