👋 Hi, I’m @jkuzel02
# Welcome to my GitHub profile!
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding, Programming, Networking, DevOps & many more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with git 😀  
- 🏡 I live in the Czech Republic, Central Europe (consider it Eastern or Western yourself, I don't really care 😀, I am using what I'd been taught in local schools).
- 👶 My birthdate dates to June 2002.
- ⚡ Fun fact: besides computers, I ride scooters (like the ones that kids do 🛴, yeah! - except I need a bigger size, because of an average local adult's height).
